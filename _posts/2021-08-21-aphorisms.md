This is a public draft of a yet untitled book of aphorisms.

<p>1. You are not reading good books if you have never wondered if you should hide them before a Zoom call.</p>

<br>

<p>2. It is best to be very intelligent, and next to that, it is better to be stupid than only a little intelligent. This is confirmed by the existence of journalists. A little intelligence makes a fool dangerous to himself and others.</p>

<br>

<p>3. Peter Thiel was wrong that the contrarian question is “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” The contrarian question is "What important question would very few people allow you to ask?"</p>

<br>

<p>4. How to attract the worst people to a profession: call it "heroic."</p>

<br>

<p>5. Racism is incorrectly and insufficiently supremacist. There are a small number of individuals to whom we owe civilisation. Most people of all races are not footnotes to the story of their lives.</p>

<br>

<p>6. The person who says "code is law" intends to write the code.</p>

<br>

<p>7. The scariest man in the world is the man who wants to help you without your consent.</p>

<br>

<p>8. Before Democracy, one man was a tyrant. Under Democracy, every man is one.</p>

<br>

<p>9. I am too selfish to ever be a racist.</p>

<br>
  
<p>10. Six branches of government in the United States: legislative, executive, judicial, bureacratic, academic, and journalistic.</p>

<br>

<p>11. The whole aim of journalism is not to inform, but to alarm people about an endless series of mostly imaginary dangers.</p>

<br>

<p>12. Whoever feels the need to preface their argument with "as a" has already lost the argument.</p>

<br>

<p>13. The great strength of Americans is that the mass of them are too plainly unintellectual to consider any truly stupid idea.
