1. You are not reading good books if you've never hid some books from your shelf before a Zoom call.

2. It is best to be very intelligent; and next to that, it is better to be stupid than only a little intelligent; and this is confirmed by the existence of journalists. A little intelligence makes fools dangerous to themselves and others.
