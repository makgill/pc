1. You are not reading good books if you've never hidden some books on your shelf before a Zoom call.

2. It is best to be very intelligent, and next to that, it is better to be stupid than only a little intelligent. This is confirmed by the existence of journalists. A little intelligence makes a fool dangerous to himself and others.

3. Peter Thiel was wrong that the contrarian question is “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” The contrarian question is "What important question would very few people allow you to ask?"

4. What most people think of selflessness is actually spiritual avarice in disguise.
