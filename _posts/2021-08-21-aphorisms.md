1. You are not reading good books if you've never had to hide some books from view before a Zoom call.

2. It is best to be very intelligent, and next to that, it is better to be stupid than only a little intelligent. This is confirmed by the existence of journalists. A little intelligence makes a fool dangerous to himself and others.

3. Peter Thiel was wrong that the contrarian question is “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” The contrarian question is "What important question would very few people allow you to ask?"

4. Selflessness is spiritual avarice in disguise. 

5. A cheerful contempt for the common man and his ways is a marker for future success.
