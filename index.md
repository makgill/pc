# I am Craig's complete lack of surprise

The Biden infastructure bill crypto amendments have had one positive effect: everyone has stopped pretending government can't hurt cryptocurrencies.

Trending yesterday was the [#DontKillCrypto.](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DontKillCrypto) You could see it on most of the top Bitfluencer Twitter accounts, people who have, for the better part of a decade, play an ever-escalating and competive
game of freedom porn where the winners are picked by how ridiculous their assertions are about Bitcoin and The State.

As someone who believes in totally unregulated, free-market capitalism, I once wishfully and ignorantly believed these people had a point. *Of course,* I told myself
*Bitcoin can't be stopped or hurt by the government.*

Then I began to read what Satoshi Nakamoto [actually](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.msg1976#msg1976)[^1] wrote about Bitcoin and study how Bitcoin really works. With some helpful commentary from people like
Mike Hearn,[^2] I realised some things that should have been obvious all along. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin...

1. Do not end The State.
2. Are traceable.
3. Are subject to regulations whether we like it or not. And these regulations have a variety of enforcement regulations that make attempting to handwave them away with some lines of code foolish.
4. Can be censored indirectly and maybe directly.
5. Are all centralised.
6. Are a whole lot of other bad things I'm sure I am forgetting.

Having known this for some time, all I can do is sit on the sidelines and laugh cathartically at the spectacle of a decade of bullshit collapsing in on itself.

I am Craig's complete lack of surprise.[^3]

[^1]: When responding to a forum user who said that Bitcoin existed "outside of the reach of any government," Satoshi said "I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion."

[^2]: See Mike Hearn's BitcoinTalk quotes. 

[^3]: This is going to get me in trouble with everyone. People who hate Craig will say I'm a cultist. People who love him will welcome me to the cult! The truth is, I just think it's a great title. And, if we're being fair, Craig Wright has been a fairly lone, and often crazy, voice in the wilderness telling people that government crackdowns were coming.
